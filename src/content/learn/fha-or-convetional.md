# What are Conventional Loans?

At its core, a conventional loan is a type of mortgage that is not backed or insured by a government agency. The name "Conventional" came from it being the convention at the time.

Instead, conventional loans are offered and backed by private lenders and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Basics
Credit Score Requirements

Borrowers typically need a good to excellent credit (720+) score for a conventional loan to make sense.

While the specific credit score requirements can vary among lenders and loan programs, a credit score of 620 or higher is often the minimum threshold. However, higher credit scores can lead to more favorable interest rates and terms.
Down Payment

Conventional loans require a down payment. The minimum down payment is 3% of the home's purchase price. On "High Balance" loans the down payment is 5%. The amount of the down payment is determined by your qualifications and where you'd like your payment to be.
Property Type

Conventional loans are versatile and can be used to finance a variety of property types, including single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses, multi-unit residences. Keep in mind you can't use conventional loans to finance commercial properties or residences over 4 units.
Loan Limits

Conventional loans are subject to loan limits set by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). These limits vary by location and are adjusted annually. Read More about loan limits here

The base loan limit for 2024 is $766,550

 In certain high-cost areas, borrowers may be able to obtain High Balance conventional loans, which exceed the standard loan limits.
Fixed-Rate and Adjustable-Rate Options

Borrowers can choose between fixed-rate conventional loans, where the interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term, providing predictability in monthly payments, or adjustable-rate conventional loans, where the interest rate may change periodically based on market conditions.


We currently do not recommend adjustable loans. Adjustable loans typically come with a high origination cost and do not make sense as of 12/7/2023 for mortgage brokers. As much as we hate to tell you this, Banks typically offer the best adjustable loans. We'll keep this updated.
Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)

When the down payment is less than 20% of the home's purchase price, we will require borrowers to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI).

PMI protects the lender in case of borrower default. Borrowers can request the removal of PMI once they have sufficient equity in the home. In most cases this is 80% of the loan to value based on the original purchase price.



## PMI is not that bad for good credit borrowers

Let's consider an example: A 5% down payment on a $300k home with a borrower who has a credit score of 760.

The mortgage insurance rate would be approximately 0.3% of the loan amount per year.

(0.003)*($285,000) (Loan amount)/12 months equals $71.25/month.

That is not the worst! With a 10% down payment, it would be roughly half that amount.
Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios

Conventional loans max out at 50% for the debt to income ratio. This means that the new mortgage plus all of your monthly debts  can't exceed 50% of your monthly qualifying income.


Just because the limit is 50% doesn't mean you have a "right" to hit it. Everything in mortgage is risk based and sometimes, if there are too many risk factors such as low down payment or weaker credit, a 40% dti might not be enough.

# Summary
Conventional loans are an excellent option for high credit borrowers or borrowers with a large down payment.
